  a(href="#") Introducing Chloi

h3= article.date

p Last month I wrote a <a href="http://silentrob.me/hello-hackhut" target="_blank">quick post over on my blog</a> that Brock and I have made the plunge and stepped out on our own and we found a warm place to work at <a href="http://www.launchacademy.ca/" target="_blank">Launch Academy</a>.

p In the past two months we have been madly working on everything at once, including our brand, website, formalizing our vision, and expanding on product ideas.

p So without further ado, we want to introduce Chloi Inc. Chloi is a mobile development studio in the heart of Vancouver, born out of the need to resolve some of the pain in mobile development, and not afraid to solve some of the harder problems.

p We are really excited to share some of our vision with the community, so stay tuned here, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/Chloi_inc" target="_blank">follow us on twitter</a>, or <a href="http://chloi.io/#/contact" >message us from our home page</a> to get early access.
