Harp Platform gives designers and developers a blissful publishing experience. Edit and collaborate on plain or preprocessed <abbr>HTML</abbr>, <abbr>CSS</abbr>, and JavaScript, right in your Dropbox. Harp Platform takes care of the rest.

Preprocessing is built-in, so Markdown, <abbr>LESS</abbr>, CoffeeScript and more can be used just as easily as <abbr>HTML</abbr>, <abbr>CSS</abbr>, and JavaScript. Custom domains and clean <abbr>URL</abbr>s make your site easier to find and share. Plus, every application comes with <abbr>SSL</abbr> by default.

## How it works

The Harp Platform was built from the ground up with the intended purpose off getting the most out of static applications. It leverages the strengths of not having a server side runtime to provide a superior developer and end-user experiences. The Harp Platform provides extremely fast deployments, quick reponse times, and full history and instant rollbacks.
