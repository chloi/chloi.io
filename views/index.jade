      h2 About
      p Chloi's vision is to grow a world-class consulting firm focusing on real problems in both the web and mobile markets. We believe in a strong balance between timelines, product quality and scope.

      p We believe Chloi’s tremendous attribute is to be able to work anywhere in the software stack, this means being able to make tough architecture decisions in areas that could effect a unrelated piece of the stack. An example would be how a complex webpage relates to how data is modelled and queried. Another example is how an API can effect how the data is described in the database or consumed in an application.
